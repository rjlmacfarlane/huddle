# Able Sense Dev Candidate Skill Test

## Completed by Ryan MacFarlane

## Notes:

Thank you for presenting this challenge. It has been my first experience building and styling a page from scratch and without any existing elements or default styles to work within. It was a fun and interesting learning opportunity!

My approach was as follows: I began by examining the provided design JPGs to determine the disparate and common attributes between each element, and how these would change between mobile and desktop views. Thereafter, I sketched out a pair of colour-coded grids for the footer and associated each colour with a class to aid the coding task later on.

Once planning was complete, I tackled the project in a top-down fashion. First, I coded the uppermost elements in HTML, then applied CSS rules to them. This pattern was repeated until the footer, which was its own project. Once the footer was complete, I created and positioned the call-to-action box which straddles the boundry between the main content and the footer. Upon completing the layout, I then applied the active states to the buttons, links, and icons.

## Comments & Observations:

1. The instructions specify 375px and 1440px as the design-to viewport widths. My sense is that more breakpoints are required to ensure a consistently tidy look across this wide range, however I ultimately decided to adhere exactly to the instructions given. As such, the page displays best at 375px and 1440px.

2. I gave thought to spreading the CSS across multiple files. There appears to be some debate about what consitutes best practice here. Ultimately I defaulted to the one-page, one-layout precept relayed to me by an experienced developer.

3. A peculiarairty I encountered was that the email address differs between the design JPGs provided. In the desktop view, 'example@huddle.com' is displayed, while in the mobile view 'example@fylo.com' is displayed. This seemed unlikely to be intentional, but I went ahead and implemented this dynamic behaviour anyway. In a real-world scenario this would have been a question for whoever assigned me the task.

4. I was not able to locate the circular social media icons within the resources provided. The icons which appear are the closest match I could find.
